- Hi, I’m @Manyo9
- I’m interested in InfoSec mostly. I've been working as a web pentester for 3 years.
- I’m currently doing a programming course at my uni, I only need to develop my final project.
- I plan to dive into networking and cloud next.

- Most of my activity happened on private repos related to my programming degree.
